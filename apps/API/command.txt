create python environment, and activate it

run "pip install -r requirements_with_model_latest.txt"

if any error appears, it may causes from error timeout, because the libraries are too much. solution for this problem is try to re-install it again to complete installation for the remaining libraries. 

if error appears causes from any required module doesn't included properly in txt file, please install it manually by simply "pip install bla bla bla".

after finish installation, then;

run "protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=."   # within TensorFlow/models/research/ folder
run "python -m pip install ."

try to go with it (see if there is an error or not)

if there's any check through pyhon shell these following library;

-from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
-from object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as viz_utils
-from object_detection.builders import model_builder
-from object_detection.utils import config_util
-from object_detection.protos import pipeline_pb2
-from google.protobuf import text_format

if all of them succeed imported, then the script should be fine

demo for real use case in runtime application will be shown at the video
